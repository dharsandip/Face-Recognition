Here a face identification program of bolywood celebrities has been developed using FaceNet face recognition model developed by Google. We prepared some datasets of bolywood celebrity images first (both training set and test set), extracted faces from given pictures via a face detection system and then extracted face features via face embeddings. Then we used SVM classifier model to fit the training data, evaluated the performace and accuracy of the training and test set dataset, identified the celebrities correctly from the testset.
